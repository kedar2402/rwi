Dust is the primary factor in the proto-planetary disk, as it helps in
dust evolution[Larson, 2003]. While finding the instability in the dusty
proto-planetary disks/rings,essential understanding is even a tiny amount
of dust can make a disk stable or unstable [Lin and Youdin, 2017]. I have
demonstrated the detailed theory of the Rossby wave instability (RWI) in
the non-homentropic and non-axisymmetric protoplanetary disk through
tabular and graphical analysis. The main focus is instability due to dust;
for that, I have considered a perfectly coupled single fluid in the proto-
planetary disk that consists of a large amount of gas and a small number
of dust particles, and the fluid is perfectly coupled in nature [Lin and
Youdin, 2017] [Natta et al., 2006]. The whole process I have done in the
2 Dimension model, and by neglecting drag and self-gravity. To reach the
conclusion, I worked on the recreation of the gaseous rings from [Li et al.,
2000] and [Lovelace et al., 1999]and also plotted the dust ring and gas
rings. This report shows how the non-homentropic dusty proto-planetary
disks are unstable using considered values of the functions and assump-
tions.
